On one fatal day with his father on a fishing trip, they accident lost their way home after a day work. The sea was rough scary, the atmosphere was dark and worrisome in cause their boat to be sail to a near by island far away from home. During there stay on the island, Jusu enjoy the beauty of nature so much that he desire that he must explore it. After 2 weeks on the island, they finally got a rescue from a ship that came near. Whilst on the ship getting home, he inquire of the sailor that he should help him explore the nature of the sea which the sailor Michael Degot Lawson accepted. Lansana later spoke to his dad about his quest but his dad was not well pleased with the idea but after the sailor spoke to him to let his son do his exploration he didn't decline.
