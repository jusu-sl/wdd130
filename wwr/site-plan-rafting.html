We are targeting this group for now because most of our available facitities and services can works well for them. We came to realize that our company ran out of life jackets which are very important whilst sailing, touring and traveling on our ferries, boats and ships. This complain has reached us and we are happy to inform you that we now have enough life jackets at our disposal. We will soon be introducing new brands of boats with more exciting and fascinating options. We will also be officially launching our $ 5 million submarie. The new boats are more convenient and safe to travel with. The submarie will address the needs of under water tourism. It will be used by students to do underwater studies.
